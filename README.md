## Overview
Scam artists make a lot of promises about AI, often claiming it can do things it cannot, such as predicting the future. What AI is truly good at is calculating. This application allows you to import your data, transform it using AI to perform calculations, and report and export the results.

## Features
This application enables you to create your own Personal Data Warehouse by:
  - Importing your data from Excel, SQL Server, and Microsoft Fabric Warehouse
  - Feeding the structure of your data, as well as your data questions and transformations, to the AI of your choice, either in the cloud or running on your local computer
    
## Benefits
Typically, a data warehouse operates in the cloud. When you access your data—even just to view it—you incur compute costs (in other words, you pay). But you already have a computer with a CPU and memory capable of handling most tasks. Wouldn’t it be great to view, edit, and transform your data right on your own machine? Now you can!

## Introducing Your Local Data Processing Tool
This tool allows you to:

* Import data from sources such as:
  - Excel
  - CSV
  - Parquet
  - SQL Server
  - Fabric Warehouse
* Transform data using AI-powered features.
* Export data back to any of the supported formats:
  - Excel
  - CSV
  - Parquet
  - SQL Server
  - Fabric Warehouse
    
By doing the compute locally on your own computer, you avoid expensive cloud compute costs while enjoying the flexibility and control of your own system.
