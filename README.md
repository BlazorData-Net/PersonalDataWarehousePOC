# PersonalDataWarehousePOC

All data warehouses operate in the cloud. When you access your data—even just to view it—you incur compute costs (in other words, you pay). But you already have a computer with a CPU and memory capable of handling most tasks. Wouldn’t it be great to view, edit, and transform your data right on your own machine? Now you can! 

## Introducing Your Local Data Processing Tool
This tool allows you to:

* Import data from sources such as:
  - Excel
  - CSV
  - Parquet
  - SQL Server
  - Fabric Warehouse
* Transform data using AI-powered features.
* Export data back to any of the supported formats:
  - Excel
  - CSV
  - Parquet
  - SQL Server
  - Fabric Warehouse
    
By doing the compute locally on your own computer, you avoid expensive cloud compute costs while enjoying the flexibility and control of your own system.
